# Pyintro

This repository contains something I recorded when learning python.

"littleSpider" is a spider to collect comments of [Lenovo Y7000P](https://item.jd.com/100004014613.html), and then construct a word cloud.

"MIT 6.0002" generally contains the course materials and my practice codes when learning [MIT 6.0002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1lhuz6pZC0&list=PLUl4u3cNGP619EG1wp0kT-7rDE_Az5TNd).

"officialTutorial" corresponds to the code blocks in the python official [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/).

"Pytorch" contains the pytorch tutorials for beginners, basically the ipython notebooks from the original authors.
